# Tasks: Book Master Plan

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-book-master-plan/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included in this task list as they were not explicitly requested in the feature specification. The validation approach focuses on manual testing of navigation, content display, and code example functionality.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Single Docusaurus project structure:
- **Content**: `docs/` (all chapters and pages)
- **Components**: `src/components/` (React components)
- **Static**: `static/` (images, code, validation scripts)
- **Config**: Root level (docusaurus.config.js, sidebars.js, package.json)

---

- [ ] T008 [P] Enable math equations by configuring remark-math and rehype-katex in docusaurus.config.js
- [ ] T009 Create sidebars.js with 5 collapsible module sections (FR-001): module-0-getting-started, module-1-ros2, module-2-digital-twin, module-3-isaac, module-4-vla, module-5-capstone
- [ ] T010 [P] Create docs/_category_.json files for each module directory with label, position, collapsible: true
- [ ] T011 [P] Configure custom CSS in src/css/custom.css for dark mode colors, code block styling, and responsive breakpoints
- [ ] T012 Create GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/deploy.yml with steps: npm install, npm run build, deploy to gh-pages
- [ ] T013 [P] Setup markdownlint configuration in .markdownlint.json for consistent Markdown formatting
- [ ] T014 [P] Create .env.example with placeholder variables for Algolia API keys (ALGOLIA_APP_ID, ALGOLIA_API_KEY, ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel
