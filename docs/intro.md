# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Simulation to Reality

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This 13-week curriculum takes you from fundamental concepts to building autonomous humanoid systems, combining simulation-first learning with real-world applications.

## 📚 Course Overview

This textbook is structured into 5 progressive modules that build upon each other:

- **Module 0**: Getting Started (Weeks 1-2) – Course orientation and development environment setup  
- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System – ROS 2 (Weeks 3-5)  
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin – Gazebo & Unity (Weeks 6-7)  
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain – NVIDIA Isaac (Weeks 8-10)  
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action Models (Weeks 11-12)  
- **Module 5**: Capstone Project – Autonomous Humanoid (Weeks 13-14)
