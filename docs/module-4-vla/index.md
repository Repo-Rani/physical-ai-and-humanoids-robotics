# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Models (Weeks 11-12)

This module explores the cutting edge of robotics: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that enable natural language control and multimodal interaction. You'll learn to integrate large language models with robotic systems, creating conversational interfaces that bridge human intent and robotic action.

## Module Overview

VLA models represent the convergence of artificial intelligence and robotics, enabling robots to understand and execute complex commands expressed in natural language. This module covers the integration of LLMs with robotic systems, from basic voice command processing to sophisticated cognitive planning.

## Hardware Requirements

This module requires the **Premium** hardware tier:
- Physical AI Edge Kit (Jetson Orin Nano + RealSense D435i + microphone)
- OR Cloud GPU access (AWS g5.xlarge for inference)
- RealSense D435i depth camera
- USB microphone for voice input

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac
- Basic understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Familiarity with ROS 2 integration of external APIs

## Module Structure

This module consists of 5 chapters covering VLA concepts:

- **Chapter 4.1**: Convergence of LLMs and Robotics (Week 11)
- **Chapter 4.2**: Voice-to-Action with OpenAI Whisper (Week 11)
- **Chapter 4.3**: Cognitive Planning with Language Models (Week 11)
- **Chapter 4.4**: Integrating GPT Models for Conversational Robotics (Week 12)
- **Chapter 4.5**: Multi-Modal Interaction: Speech, Gesture, Vision (Week 12)

## Learning Path

The VLA capabilities learned in this module will be integrated into the capstone project in Module 5, where you'll create a fully autonomous humanoid robot with natural language interaction capabilities.
