# Module 0: Getting Started (Weeks 1-2)

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum! This foundational module orients you to the course structure, helps you set up your development environment, and introduces core Physical AI concepts that will guide your learning journey.

## Module Overview

Module 0 serves as your entry point to the 13-week Physical AI curriculum. You'll explore what makes Physical AI different from Digital AI, understand the course structure, and set up your development environment. This module also introduces the fundamental concepts that underpin all subsequent learning.

## Hardware Requirements

This module requires no special hardware - you can complete it with a standard laptop or desktop computer.

## Prerequisites

No prior robotics experience is required. Basic familiarity with command line interfaces and programming concepts will be helpful but is not mandatory.

## Module Structure

This module consists of 3 chapters that will prepare you for the rest of the curriculum:

- **Chapter 0.1**: Welcome & Course Overview (Week 1)
- **Chapter 0.2**: Development Environment Setup (Week 1)
- **Chapter 0.3**: Introduction to Physical AI (Week 2)

## Learning Path

After completing Module 0, you'll have a solid foundation for progressing through the curriculum. Each subsequent module builds on the previous one, creating a comprehensive learning path from ROS 2 fundamentals through to autonomous humanoid systems.

## Next Steps
