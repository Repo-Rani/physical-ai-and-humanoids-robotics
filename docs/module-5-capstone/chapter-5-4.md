# Chapter 5.4: Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance

Autonomous navigation is fundamental for mobile humanoids. This chapter implements a complete navigation system with dynamic obstacle avoidance and human-aware behaviors.

## Content coming soon

This chapter will cover configuring Nav2 stack for humanoid platform kinematics and constraints, tuning costmap parameters for dynamic obstacle representation, implementing global path planning with Smac Planner for complex environments, configuring local trajectory planning with DWB controller for smooth motion, integrating VSLAM (cuVSLAM) for robust localization without external beacons, implementing dynamic obstacle avoidance from LiDAR and camera sensors, designing human-aware navigation with social distance and yielding behaviors, implementing recovery behaviors for navigation failures and deadlocks, testing navigation performance in crowded and constrained environments, and optimizing real-time performance for responsive autonomous motion.
