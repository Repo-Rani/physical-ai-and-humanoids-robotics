# Chapter 5.3: Voice Processing and Command Interface

Voice interaction is a key capability for humanoid robots. This chapter implements a complete voice command pipeline from speech recognition to action execution.

## Content coming soon

This chapter will cover integrating OpenAI Whisper for real-time speech recognition in ROS 2, implementing intent classification from transcribed speech using GPT models, parsing natural language commands into structured robot actions, mapping intents to ROS 2 action servers and service calls, executing multi-step tasks from voice commands, generating natural language feedback for user confirmation, implementing text-to-speech for spoken robot responses, handling speech recognition errors and ambiguity gracefully, designing wake word detection for hands-free interaction, and evaluating voice interface usability and reliability metrics.
