# Chapter 5.5: Computer Vision and Object Manipulation

Vision-guided manipulation enables humanoids to interact with their environment. This chapter implements object detection, pose estimation, and manipulation control.

## Content coming soon

This chapter will cover deploying YOLOv8 for real-time object detection on robot platforms, implementing 6D pose estimation for manipulation target localization, integrating depth cameras for point cloud-based perception, planning collision-free grasps with MoveIt 2 motion planning framework, executing pick-and-place tasks with trajectory control, implementing closed-loop visual servoing for precision manipulation, handling occlusions and partial views in cluttered environments, designing error recovery strategies for manipulation failures, integrating tactile and force feedback for robust grasping, and evaluating manipulation success rates and cycle times for benchmark tasks.
