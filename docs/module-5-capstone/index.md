# Module 5: Capstone Project - Autonomous Humanoid (Weeks 13-14)

This capstone module brings together everything you've learned throughout the curriculum to create a functioning autonomous humanoid robot. You'll integrate perception, planning, control, and AI capabilities into a cohesive system that can respond to voice commands, navigate environments, identify objects, and manipulate items.

## Module Overview

The capstone project represents the culmination of your learning journey, requiring you to synthesize concepts from all previous modules into a working autonomous system. You'll face the challenges of system integration, debugging multi-node systems, and optimizing performance across the entire robotics stack.

## Hardware Requirements

This module requires the **Premium** hardware tier:
- Full Physical AI Edge Kit (Jetson Orin Nano + RealSense + microphone)
- Access to physical humanoid platform OR simulation environment with complete humanoid model
- Target environment for navigation and manipulation tasks

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed all previous modules (0-4)
- Successfully implemented code examples and exercises from all modules
- Understanding of ROS 2, simulation, Isaac, and VLA integration

## Module Structure

This module consists of 6 chapters covering system integration:

- **Chapter 5.1**: Capstone Overview: The Autonomous Humanoid (Week 13)
- **Chapter 5.2**: System Integration and Testing (Week 13)
- **Chapter 5.3**: Voice Command Processing Pipeline (Week 13)
- **Chapter 5.4**: Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance (Week 14)
- **Chapter 5.5**: Computer Vision for Object Identification (Week 14)
- **Chapter 5.6**: Manipulation and Grasping (Week 14)

## Learning Path

This module represents the final integration of all concepts learned throughout the curriculum. Success here demonstrates mastery of the complete Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics skill set.
