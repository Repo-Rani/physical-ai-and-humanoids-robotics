# Chapter 5.6: Testing, Validation, and Deployment

Rigorous testing and validation ensure the capstone system works reliably. This final chapter covers testing strategies, simulation validation, deployment, and performance evaluation.

## Content coming soon

This chapter will cover designing comprehensive test strategies for robotics systems, implementing unit tests for individual ROS 2 nodes using pytest, creating integration tests for multi-node subsystems with launch_testing, validating system performance in Gazebo simulation environments, designing scenario-based tests for edge cases and failure modes, implementing continuous integration pipelines for automated testing, creating real-world deployment checklists and safety protocols, conducting user acceptance testing with stakeholders, measuring and reporting system performance metrics (latency, accuracy, reliability), documenting capstone project with technical reports and demonstrations, and preparing portfolio presentations showcasing autonomous humanoid capabilities.
